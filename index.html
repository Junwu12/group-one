                This chart shows the trend of the ratio of the total amount of carbon dioxide produced by schools over the years.It can be seen from the trend that the amount of carbon dioxide produced by the school per unit area is decreasing, which shows the school’s efforts and contributions to environmental protection.

            <div>
                There is an increase of the total amount of composted food on campus in every September when the fall semester starts. This might be caused by the fact that there are usually more activities held on campus during this time of each year.
               <br> Comparatively, the total amount of composted food is the lowest during May, June, and July, which is the summer break. Because during this time, most students are not living on campus.

                This bar graphs represent the development of expansion area of Northeastern University among 12 years from 2011-2022, and the proportion of construction waste generated in the university and recycled part in 2022. Which can encourage faculties, students and construction workers to pay attention to construction pollution and encourage everyone to increase their motivationand action in waste recycling.

            <div>
                NEU campus experiences a peak in energy consumption during the summertime, particularly from June to September.  It could caused by air conditioning usage but most students are off campus due to summer vacation.  The AC may running even when the classrooms are empty.
                Since energy consumption peaks in the summertime, the campus could invest in more energy-efficient air conditioning systems or upgrade the current ones. Implementing smart thermostats that adjust temperature based on occupancy could also help.
                Consider installing solar panels on building rooftops. The summer months, with increased daylight hours, would provide an opportunity to harness solar energy and offset some of the campus's energy consumption.
